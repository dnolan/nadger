Disclaimer 
========================================
This application was developed in my spare time to help me learn Delphi. 
By using this application you understand that it may fubar your system, 
eat your cat and steal all your pizza. If it does, it was of course not 
intentional and therefore don't blame me. Of course pizza donations will 
not be turned down.
